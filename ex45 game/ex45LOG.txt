Done:
-Player's inventory
-Player's inventory check
-Room items work as hashes
-"Take" action
-"Throw" action, but basic functionality only
-"Inspect" action done, it deletes the old key and replaces the inspected one
 will link to "Take" action
-"Hide" action is done, and it will change the players hidden status to false
 or true.
-"Use" action is done, it will check if item being used is a small key or
crowbar and open a locked door.

18/01
-Monster class is finished
-Main loop is kind of structured
-Monster sequence is kind of structured
-Noise system done in main loop
-Separated classes and methods in different files.

19/01
-Room connections map is finished on paper.
-Monster moves randomly between rooms if it hasn't noticed noise from player's
current room. When adding more rooms, you need to add it to the unlockedRooms hash,
the roomsID hash and modify the randomRoom rand to meet the number of total IDs

20/01
-TakeItem is fixed and properly implemented. Now will always cause a lot of
noise when taking an item without inspecting it.
-Player is now able to inspect doors to get a clue on how to open it.
-Monster will now move through all the unlocked rooms the player has unlocked.
-Corridor now has a hash with doors. If you use a small key on any of those
doors, a new room will be unlocked and the door will be removed from the
corridorDoors hash.
-Rooms now have a hasAccessTo array that will connect each other. This way
only a certain number of rooms are connected to each other, so you can't go
from the Bedroom to the Attic without going through the Corridor first.

21/01
-Main entrance has been added as corridor door instead of object, if big key is
used in main entrance door, game is over.

22/01
-Move action will now only display unlocked rooms doors.
-Throw item was partially done and needs more work

24/01
-Inspecting doors in corridor will hint at Small key usage or crowbar usage.
-All rooms have been added with respective items and hiding spots.
-1 second has been added between certain prompts to make it less confusing.
-Opening a door in the corridor will now let the player know the item has been
properly used and the door has been opened.
-Basement has an ornament locker that can only be open with the ornament key,
the locker contains the Big key to escape the house.

27/01
-Fixed a bug where monster would move in an unexpected way.
-Fixed a bug where the roomsID order would not coincide with the opening order
of doors, making the monster go to rooms unopened.


Next time, start with:
-Improving existing functions and Classes

-Write comments for all functions and attributes that are not yet written for
clarity.

-Noticed that if flag as High noise, the monster will follow the player to any
room, but if the monster randomly moves with no high noise flag, you can either
hide or move to a different room.

-Give functionality to throwItem, have it so you throw items to the rooms you
can access from current room and lure the monster there.

-Have beta testers try the game

-Some error messages and beauty options are missing









-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The game will be about escaping from a house you suddenly woke up in.
There will be a blind monster that will randomly go around rooms, but will prioritize going to rooms with the highest level noise.

Each room will be an object created from its respective class, with attributes that will change as the player interacts with them.

The player will also be an object that will change depending on the interactions with the rooms.

The objective is to escape the house, and for that you will need either a key, or an axe.
The axe will make noise and will require you to use it 5 times.
The key will make no noise and you'll be able to escape without issues.

The player will be able to do the following actions(these will be functions used by player):
  -Inspect: Inspects any chosen object, this action will make noise, ranging from little to a lot depending on object attributes.
  -Move: Moves player to another room.
  -Use: Uses an item from inventory
  -Hide: You hide somewhere in the room in case the monster comes into the room.
  -Throw Item: Will allow you to throw any item from your inventory anywhere outside the room to lure the monster away.
  -Take: Take any item.

The rooms in the house are:
  -Kitchen
  -Bedroom
  -Livingroom
  -Bathroom
  -Attic
  -Corridor
  -Garden
  -Basement
  -Garage
  -Pantry
Rooms will have an array that with items.

The item types are:
  -Axe (Used to end game)
  -Entrance Key (Used to end game)
  -Small Key (Opens any doors/locks)
  -Crossbar (Opens any doors/locks but makes a lot of noise)
  -Cutlery/Trash (Used to throw and lure monster away)
