Key terms

Sinatra is a library that was built using ruby
Rails extends this making it more complex.



-erb => embedded ruby
-render => display
-persist => adding data to db
-request/response flows of webs are important
-DSL- Domain Specific Language => Means that is it only found for its specific language, in Sinatra's case, Ruby.
-MVC - Models, views, controllers => Dictates request/response flow



Client vs server
-Client is is the user requesting side
-Server is the application



MVC
- Controller should always be the middle man beween model and view, never do
requests to DB from views, always code that kind of stuff in controller.







Routes(these are requests):
-Post is a request that takes info from the user and sends it to the Server,
basically hitting submit while doing a form, or anything like that.

-Get is a request that gets something(data) from server.

-Put will take out a record and update the entire thing, which could cause performance issues.
-Patch will also update like Put, but will only take what's necessary to update

-Delete will delete anything passed to it, for example deleting a profile.
